# Collaborative-Recommender
Collaborative Recommender system for IBDM dataset

One innovative project idea in machine learning for data science could be building a personalized recommendation system. The project could include the following steps:

Collecting and cleaning a dataset of user interactions with items (e.g. movie ratings, product purchases, etc.).
Exploring the data to gain insights and identify patterns.
Preprocessing the data, including feature engineering and normalization.
Training a model such as a collaborative filtering, matrix factorization or deep learning based recommendation model using a portion of the data.
Testing the model's performance on a separate portion of the data and evaluating the accuracy of the recommendations.
Integrating the model into a personalized recommendation system that can make personalized recommendations for individual users based on their past interactions and preferences.
Also, testing the model with A/B testing to validate the performance of the recommendation system.
Another idea could be building a deep learning-based image captioning model, which takes an image as input and generates a natural language caption that describes the contents of the image. This project would involve training a deep learning model on a dataset of images and their associated captions, and then using the trained model to generate captions for new images.

These are just a couple of examples, but there are many other innovative projects that can be undertaken in the field of machine learning for data science, depending on your interests and the available data.

A recommendation system is a tool that helps users discover new items they may be interested in by suggesting items based on their past interactions and preferences.

The first step of the project would be to collect and clean a dataset of user interactions with items. This dataset could include information such as movie ratings, product purchases, or music listening history. Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This step includes handling missing values, removing outliers and duplicate data, and normalizing the data if necessary.

The next step is to train a model using a portion of the data. There are several types of models that can be used for recommendation systems, such as collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and deep learning-based models. Collaborative filtering is based on the idea that users who have similar past interactions with items are likely to have similar preferences in the future. Matrix factorization is a technique that decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower dimensional representations of users and items. Deep learning-based models can also be used to make recommendations by training a neural network on the user-item interactions data.

After training the model, it's important to evaluate its performance on a separate portion of the data. This can be done by comparing the predicted ratings or recommendations to the actual ratings or interactions in the test data set. This step is crucial to understand the model's accuracy and also to fine-tune the model if needed.

The final step is to integrate the model into a personalized recommendation system that can make personalized recommendations for individual users based on their past interactions and preferences. This can be done by creating a web or mobile application that allows users to input their preferences and receive personalized recommendations.

It's also important to test the model with A/B testing, which is a technique for comparing two versions of a product or service, in this case the recommendation system, to see which one performs better. This can be done by randomly splitting the users into two groups, one group receives the recommendations generated by the model and the other group receive the recommendations generated by a different approach, then compare the performance of the recommendations and see which approach is better.

=====================================================================

There are several sources where you can find suitable datasets for building a personalized recommendation system. One popular options include:

The MovieLens dataset: This dataset contains more than 20 million ratings and 465,000 tag applications applied to 27,000 movies by 138,000 users. It's one of the most popular datasets for building recommendation systems and is available for free on the GroupLens website (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

=====================================================================

This is just a simple example, but there are many other datasets available for building recommendation systems. It's always a good idea to check different sources and find the dataset that best fits your project's requirements.
